 Epoch store
    The epoch store is a consistent metadata store that provides 2 functions:
      Provide monotonically increasing epoch numbers. During sequencer activation, the epoch store provides epoch numbers through read-modify-write transactions. The sequencer retrieves the current number and bumps the number.
      Store the current replication configuration for each log. It also stores the last clean (fully recovered) epoch (LCE) of the log.
